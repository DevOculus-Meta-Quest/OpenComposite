To collect/refresh PGO data:

1. Build ReleaseAVX2_PGOGEN.  This would do two things:
	- Create instrumented openvr_api.dll
	- Overwrite pgo\openvr_api_saved.pgd with the new .pgd.  Do not check this one in yet, until step 7 is complete.
2. Place instrumented openvr_api.dll into game folder
3. Place pgort140.dll next to instrumented openvr_api.dll
4. Place pgort140.dll in Oculus Runtime folder: c:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-runtime\
5. Run the game
6. Copy openvr_api![N].pgc back to pgo folder
7. Build Realease_AVX2.  This will:
	- produce merged pgo\openvr_api.pgd
	- Overwrite pgo\openvr_api_saved.pgd with the new merged .pgd.
8. Check in the newly merged .pgd
