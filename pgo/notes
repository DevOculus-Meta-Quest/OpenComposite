To collect PGO data:

* Build ReleaseAVX2_PGOGEN.  This would do two things:
	- Create instrumented openvr_api.dll
	- Overwrite pgo\openvr_api_saved.pgd with the new .pgd.
* Place instrumented openvr_api.dll into game folder
* Place pgort140.dll next to instrumented openvr_api.dll
* Place pgort140.dll in Oculus Runtime folder: c:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-runtime\
* Run the game
* Copy openvr_api![N].pgc back to pgo folder
* Build Realease_AVX2.  This will:
	- produce merged pgo\openvr_api.pgd
	- Overwrite pgo\openvr_api_saved.pgd with the new merged .pgd.
* Check in the newly merged .pgd
